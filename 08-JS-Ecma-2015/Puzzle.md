A **sliding puzzle**, is a [combination puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_puzzle "Combination puzzle") that challenges a player to slide (frequently flat) pieces along certain routes (usually on a board) to establish a **certain end-configuration**. The pieces to be moved may consist of simple shapes, or they may be imprinted with colors, patterns, sections of a larger picture (like a jigsaw puzzle), numbers, or letters.
## Guidelines
It might be enough with the gif above, but let's describe it a little bit, so you can have a better idea on how you can get it done.
 - You're going to use numbers
 - It is a two dimension table 3 x 3
 - It should have one empty block to create the movement
 - It should paint a color to shows when the configurations was achieved
